Messing around with Docker, CoreOS, Fig, and anything else that looks shiny!


## TODO

- CoreOS to see the private Docker repository we have running
  - Does this change where we host the registry
  - - OR - Do we improve our knowledge of PORT mappings
  - - OR - Do we add a 192.168.56 range to the CoreOS Vagrant (preferred)
